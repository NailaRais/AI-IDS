# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (AI-IDS)

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (AI-IDS)** is an innovative security solution that leverages artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and machine learning to detect and respond to potential intrusions in real-time. This project aims to enhance the cybersecurity posture of organizations by utilizing advanced techniques for threat detection, ensuring the integrity of security logs, and providing actionable insights to security personnel.

### Objectives
- Implement an AI-based model to identify potential threats and intrusions.
- Utilize blockchain technology for secure logging and storage of security alerts.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing alerts.
- Ensure real-time analytics and insights into security incidents.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

- `smart_contracts/`: Contains Solidity smart contracts for managing the logging of security events on the blockchain.
- `backend/`: The Node.js backend API that handles requests, processes data, and interacts with the database.
- `frontend/`: A React-based frontend application that provides a user interface for monitoring alerts and visualizing data.
- `machine_learning/`: Scripts for training, testing, and predicting with the machine learning model used for intrusion detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum for smart contract deployment and secure data transactions.
- **Frontend**: React for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing security alerts and user data.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow for developing the intrusion detection model.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (version 4.0 or higher)
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **TensorFlow** (version 2.0 or higher)
- **Metamask**: A crypto wallet for interacting with Ethereum.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started, clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-IDS.git
   cd AI-IDS
   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
   Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**:
   Start the backend server by executing:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend Application**:
   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the React application:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Train the Machine Learning Model**:
   Finally, train the machine learning model by running the training script:
   ```bash
   cd machine_learning
   python train.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Web Interface**: Once both the backend and frontend are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the web interface.
- **Logging Alerts**: Use the interface to log security alerts and view real-time intrusion data.
- **Monitor Blockchain**: The application integrates with Ethereum to securely log and monitor alerts, ensuring data integrity.
